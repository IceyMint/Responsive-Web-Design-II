# responsive-web-design

For this challenge, you are free to choose the CSS-only project or you can jump into the LESS project.

## Task: 

Build an adaptive website that has breakpoints at 400px, 768px, and 1100px.  This project is very open ended and meant to challenge what you learned today.  The correct solution will have breakpoints at the directed values but how it looks is up to you.  

Remember that an adaptive layout updates at breakpoints only.  Don't worry about percent based fluid layouts.  That's coming up in the next project.
